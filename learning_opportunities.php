                <li>Bell Choir for children up to 6th grade. Practice is held during the Sunday school hour, and
                    children share their music several times a year in worship. Bells are color-coded, making it
                    possible for even the littlest ringers to participate.
                </li>
                <li>Middle school/High School Youth Group (grades 6-12) meets on monthly for activities or meals. Our
                    youth regularly participate in worship and serve Christ through mission. Each year we send a team of
                    youth for a week-long mission project.
                </li>
