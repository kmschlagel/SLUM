        <h2>Helping Others</h2>
        
        <p>Silver Lake United Methodist Church believes in reaching out to help others. We offer a variety of ways to serve -- within our church, our community and the world at large.</p>
        
        <p><em>The North St. Paul Ecumenical Food Shelf </em> provides food for needy people in the communities of North St. Paul, Oakdale and Maplewood.</p>
        
         <p><em>The Emma Norton Residence,</em> located in downtown St. Paul, provides transitional housing for women and children, including those dealing with issues of domestic abuse, unemployment and chemical dependency. We support the Emma Norton Residence with our financial gifts, and the women's group of our church hosts special events for the residents.  </p>
         
          <p><em>Open arms.</em> Silver Lake is a hub location for Open Arms of Minnesota, an organization that delivers meals to people with chronic illnesses. Each Monday we deliver a week's worth of food to people who are in need on behalf of Open Arms.</p>
          
           <p><em>The Silver Lake Christmas Project</em> changes yearly. For the last few years we have provided warm hats, scarves and mittens to the homeless teens served by YouthLink in Minneapolis. </p>
